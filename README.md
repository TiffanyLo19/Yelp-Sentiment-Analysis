# Yelp Sentiment Analysis with LSTM and Naive Bayes

This project focuses on sentiment text analysis of Yelp reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The sentiment analysis is implemented through two distinct models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Naive Bayes classifier. By combining the strengths of both models, the goal is to achieve accurate and robust sentiment predictions for Yelp reviews.
